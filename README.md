# Perceptron

## Update
I am trying to use this simple Perceptron to train the Flappy-Bird game which is still in process. I will update it here soon.


## Requirement- Graphics.h

Precompiled lib for debian architecture are with the code.

This code is written in C++ and Graphics.h is used to visualize the results during computation. Algorithm of the code is based on the very asic idea of Perceptron which takes x and y cordinates to learn whether a point is above Y=X line. 

## Run
make

## Executable
Executable takes 3 arguments first number of training points, second is iteration over training and third argument is no. of testing points.
To run it type this:
./run 10 1 200
